* ATMEGA328:- It is high performance, low power controller from Microchip. ATMEGA328P is a 8-bit microcontroller based on AVR RISC architecture. It is the most popular of all AVR controllers as it is used in ARDUINO boards. ATMEGA328P is a 28 pin chip.
* Power Supply:- A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. 
* Switch:- Switch category that provides a switch or a push button.
* Temperature Sensor:- Temperature sensor is a device, used to measure the temperature using an electrical signal, the change in the temperature correspond to change in its physical property like resistance or voltage.
* UART Display:- UART (universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter) is one of the most common methods for commnunication between two devices.UART LED Displays are using 4 Pins UART interface for all models.
* Heat Generator:- Heat generator is a device that takes the user inputs and maintain that temperature.
* LED:- A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current flows through it.
